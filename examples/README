	arith.cl	Tests various aspects of arithmetic in Cool.

	atoi.cl		An implementation of the C function by the
			same name. It converts a String into an Int.

	atoi_test.cl	An example program using atoi.cl. Since you

			language in obscure ways.			

	hello_world.cl  The classic first program.

	primes.cl	An unusual prime number generator.

	graph.cl	A program reading descriptions of weighted-
			directed graphs from stdin in text format.

	g1.graph	A sample input to graph.cl

	palindrome.cl	Recognizes palindromes.
