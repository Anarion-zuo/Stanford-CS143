# My CS143 Programming Solutions

This is my programming solutions to CS143 of Stanford Computer Science. It is based on the [download link](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+1T2020+type@asset+block@student-dist.tar.gz) from a [course website](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+2T2020/course/) on edx.org. I searched for this course material for a long time, and presumed that you might be having the same problem.

Revert commit to the second commit, `first setup`, of this repository and you would obtain skeleton files and directory structures of this course's material. You may also download from the [download link](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+1T2020+type@asset+block@student-dist.tar.gz) if the link still works.

The second commit is derived from the first commit of this repository, which contains some code for the first programming assignment `PA1`. I did not take care to separate those, for I believe `PA1` is not so difficult or necessary, with respect to other `PA`s. You may skip `PA1` and do well in later `PA`s.

The major materials for the programming assignments are in directory [assignments](./assignments/). Some notes in PDF formats are in directory [handouts](./handouts/). Other directories are best left untroubled.

This repository is currently in development, and the solutions may not be complete or correct. Even if it is complete, you must not dishonest yourself with this repository.
